\usage{
\method{plot}{multi_dope_results_branched}(
  multi_dope_branched,
  scope = c("branch", "overall"),
  metrics = c("D_naive", "D_term", "O", "E_naive", "E_term", "DOPE_score"),
  type = c("bar", "heatmap", "radar"),
  branch_mode = c("facet", "stack", "separate"),
  branches = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{multi_dope_branched}{A result object returned by
\code{\link[=compute_multi_DOPE_branched]{compute_multi_DOPE_branched()}}, containing overall comparisons,
per-branch comparisons, and branch-level data.}

\item{scope}{Character scalar, either \code{"overall"} to plot aggregate
DOPE scores across trajectories, or \code{"branch"} to plot per-branch
metrics. Default is \code{"branch"}.}

\item{metrics}{Character vector of metric names to plot. Common options
include \code{"D_naive"}, \code{"D_term"}, \code{"O"}, \code{"E_naive"},
\code{"E_term"}, and \code{"DOPE_score"}. Defaults to all of these.}

\item{type}{Character scalar, plot type: \code{"bar"}, \code{"heatmap"},
or \code{"radar"}.}

\item{branch_mode}{For branch scope only. Controls how branches are
displayed:
\itemize{
\item \code{"facet"} – facet each branch into a separate panel,
\item \code{"stack"} – combine trajectory and branch labels
(e.g., \code{"traj1 [B]"}),
\item \code{"separate"} – for radar plots only, draw one radar per branch.
Default is \code{"facet"}.
}}

\item{branches}{Optional character vector of branch names to include
(for \code{scope = "branch"}). Defaults to all branches present.}
}
\value{
For \code{"bar"} and \code{"heatmap"}, returns a \code{ggplot} object.
For \code{"radar"}, draws the plot using base graphics and returns \code{NULL}
invisibly.
}
\description{
This function visualizes the results from
\code{\link[=compute_multi_DOPE_branched]{compute_multi_DOPE_branched()}} across trajectories and branches.
It supports bar plots, heatmaps, and radar charts, and can display
either overall aggregate DOPE scores or per-branch metrics.
}
\details{
\itemize{
\item Overall plots use \code{comparison_overall} from the branched DOPE result,
showing each trajectory’s aggregate DOPE score.
\item Branch plots iterate through \code{branch_data} and extract requested
metrics for each (trajectory, branch) pair. Metrics can be stored as
numeric values or nested lists/doubles inside each branch object; the
function extracts the first valid numeric value.
